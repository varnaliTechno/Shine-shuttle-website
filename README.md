 	A brief introduction about my Real time clientâ€™s website:
 	An airport transfer is a regularly scheduled transport service which takes passengers to a hotel or other prearranged destination from a designated airport. The service can also include a return service to a specified airport from a chosen hotel or pick-up location.
 	Typically speaking these services run on a set schedule to allow sufficient time to pick up passengers at hotels on a specific route. Operators offering airport transfer services use many passenger vans of different sizes.
 	Passengers can book their ride just before four hours on this website. They have the freedom to cancel their reservation before four hours, and they can also allow to pay after the ride. Using the feedback form, passenger can give their own opinion.  Passengers may also ask any question on the contact form.
 	I agree that this website is going to be a great improvement for passengers, so passengers can get fast and convenient travel. My website is compatible with any digital device with a browser, and like every other social media network that almost everyone uses, it is extremely portable. It is super user friendly. This website will above all improve the quality of travel.
 	In this website I have used the technologies like PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, My SQL database and hosted this website in blue host and make it live through FileZilla.
